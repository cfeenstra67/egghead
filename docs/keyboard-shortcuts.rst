Keyboard Shortcuts
====================

Keyboard shortcuts available to control Egghead:

* **Open Popup** - Open the Egghead history popup in your browser. This can allow you to do quick searches without navigating to the full history page. You can do all of the same searches here as you'd be able to in the full-sized app.

  * **Mac**: ``Cmd + E``

  * **Windows**: ``Ctrl + E``

* **Open History Page** - Open the Egghead history full-sized app in a new tab in your browser. This is a standard chrome shortcut that you use even without Egghead.

  * **Mac**: ``Cmd + Shift + E``

  * **Windows**: ``Ctrl + Shift + E``
